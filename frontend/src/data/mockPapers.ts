    adviser: "Dr. Roberto Garcia",
    abstract: "This quantitative research investigates the correlation between social media usage and academic performance among Grade 12 students at Catubig Valley National High School. Using a sample of 150 respondents, the study employed survey questionnaires and analyzed grade point averages to establish relationships. Results indicate a moderate negative correlation between excessive social media use (more than 4 hours daily) and academic performance, particularly in mathematics and science subjects. The study recommends implementing digital wellness programs and structured study schedules to mitigate negative effects.",
